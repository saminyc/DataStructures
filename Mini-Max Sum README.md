Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

Steps:
At first count the sum of the elements in the list.
Then store the minimum and maximum element of the array.
Subtract the minimum and maximum respectively from the sum found.
